# HTMLfromExcel
Used python to generate HTML tags from an excel spreadsheet to half automate member directory updates.

I assist a webmaster for a foundation website with many members. Every year the member directory needs to be updated to reflect the current members. The master list is maintained in an Excel spreadsheet. Rather than updating the member directory site page by hand, I utilized this python script to generate all the HTML I needed for each member. Please excuse the crazy HTML, I did not create it :)
